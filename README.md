## 📌 Executive Summary
This repository serves as a technical log of my Data Science residency at **Oasis Infobyte**. During this tenure, I developed three distinct predictive systems focused on agricultural optimization, automotive market analysis, and real estate valuation. 

I moved beyond basic model implementation to focus on the **integrity of the analytical pipeline**, ensuring that data cleaning, outlier mitigation, and feature scaling were prioritized to produce high variance, low bias models.

## 🛠️ The Analytical Workflow
Every project in this portfolio adheres to a structured, production grade engineering lifecycle:



1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying latent patterns and multi collinearity through correlation matrices and distribution plots.
2.  **Preprocessing & Transformation:** Standardizing numerical features and utilizing encoding techniques (One Hot / Label) for high cardinality categorical data.
3.  **Feature Selection:** Engineering and selecting variables with the highest predictive power to minimize computational overhead.
4.  **Regression Modeling:** Implementing a variety of algorithms including Linear Regression and Ensemble methods.
5.  **Validation:** Measuring performance using robust metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$).

## 📂 Project Deep Dives

### 1. Crop Yield Predictive Analysis 🌾
* **Problem:** Estimating agricultural productivity based on environmental variables and input factors.
* **Methodology:** Integrated datasets involving rainfall, pesticides, and average temperature. I focused on analyzing the historical variance of yields to identify long term productivity trends.
* **Key Outcome:** Developed a model capable of forecasting yields with high precision, aiding in resource allocation.
* **Notebook:** [Analyze Crop Yield Notebook](Project-1/crop%20yield%20prediction.ipynb)

### 2. Belarus Automotive Market Valuation 🚗
* **Problem:** Forecasting resale prices in the Belarus car market based on technical specifications and vehicle history.
* **Methodology:** Handled significant categorical variance (Manufacturer, Fuel Type, Drive Train) and performed engine volume normalization. I implemented regression models to capture the depreciation curves typical of the regional market.
* **Key Outcome:** Optimized the price prediction engine to account for mileage and vehicle age as primary weight factors.
* **Notebook:** [Analyze Car Price Notebook](Project-2/Belarus%20Car%20Price%20Prediction%20(1).ipynb)

### 3. Real Estate Price Regression 🏠
* **Problem:** Building a valuation engine for residential properties based on structural and locational features.
* **Methodology:** Conducted rigorous EDA to visualize house price distributions. I utilized feature scaling to ensure that square footage and room counts were treated with appropriate weight in the loss function.
* **Key Outcome:** Established a reliable baseline for market valuation, reducing the error margin in property estimates.
* **Notebook:** [Analyze House Price Notebook](Project-3/house%20price.ipynb)
